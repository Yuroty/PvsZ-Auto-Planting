[Once You Recorded Your Clicks Make Sure To Add/Replace Them in PvZ-Planter]



🌱 PvZ-Auto-Planter

Automate your planting process in Plants vs. Zombies — or any other game that relies on mouse clicks!

This tool records and replays your exact click positions, letting you automatically plant, collect, or perform any repetitive actions with perfect timing.

⚙️ How It Works

1. Use the included recorder script to capture your click positions.


2. It saves your coordinates in markers.txt.


3. Run the Planter script to automatically click those saved positions.


4. Your plant slot layout and resolution must match the setup you recorded on —
different screen sizes or window modes (like fullscreen vs windowed) will shift coordinates.

If you’re on a different display setup (e.g., not an old Lenovo ThinkPad),
it’s recommended to record your own markers first.



5. You can tweak the click timing and intervals directly in the script to match your system speed.
