🌱 PvZ-Auto-Planter


IMPORTANT — Safety notice:

> DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT ON SENSITIVE DATA OR IN CRITICAL APPLICATIONS. This script will automatically click the recorded positions — it can interact with any open window. The script stops automatically after it finishes its clicks, but always test in a safe environment first.



Automate your planting process in Plants vs. Zombies — or any other game that uses mouse clicks. This tool records and replays your exact click positions, letting you automatically plant, collect, or perform repetitive actions with accurate timing.

⚙️ How it works

1. Run the recorder script and perform the clicks you want recorded.


2. The recorder saves coordinates to markers.txt.


3. Run the Planter script to replay those saved positions automatically.



Notes:

Your layout and screen resolution must match the setup you recorded. Different resolutions, scaling, or fullscreen/windowed modes will shift coordinates.

If you are not using the same display setup as the person who recorded the example (for example, not the same laptop or monitor), record your own markers before running the Planter.

You can tweak click timing and intervals directly in the script to match your system’s speed.

📦 Releases / Non-Python users

If you don’t have Python installed, download the zipped --onedir build attached to the latest GitHub Release. Unzip and run following the included README inside the zip (no Python required).

> Recommended release workflow: put source in the repo and attach zipped onedir builds as Release assets (keeps main repo lightweight and transparent).

💻 Requirements

⚠️ Usage & Safety tips

Test in a safe, non-critical environment (e.g., a separate game window or dummy app) before running on your main account/game.

Close or minimize applications you don’t want affected.

Don’t run when sensitive windows (banking, chat, terminals, etc.) are open.

The script is designed to stop after its click sequence finishes — but unexpected situations can occur, so supervise the first few runs.



---

🔧 Customization

Edit timing/interval variables in the script to match latency and performance.

Re-record markers whenever you change resolution, window size, or layout.

markers.txt is human-readable — you can manually edit or swap marker files for different layouts.
